This method is inspired by pinhole cameras. 
All 3D objects are represented by their vertices, which are traced "through the pinhole" onto a screen (your viewing plane). Since straight edges will always be seen as straight in 3D, all faces can be filled in using just this information about the vertices!

All the math, code, and algorithms were formulated and written by me.

To execute, run the executable file located at ./out/artifacts/3DTest_jar/3DTest.jar

Controls:
- WASD to move
- QE to move up or down
- move mouse to move the camera
- scroll in/out to move directly towards/away from center of view
- Esc for options/pause (for now just hold Esc to freely move mouse)
